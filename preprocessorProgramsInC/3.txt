Explanation for 3.c


These are called parameterized macros.....

#define SUM(x, y) ((x)+(y)) is called parameterized macro!!!


when you call SUM(x, y) in the main() function, then the compiler replaces SUM(x, y) with its definition i.e. ((x)+(y)) and displays the output!!!!


AS SIMPLE AS THAT!!!
