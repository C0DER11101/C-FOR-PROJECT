Explanation of 7.c
------------------

The explanation of MAX(fname, dtype) is same as in 6.c

What's new here is the display() function calling maxint() first defining. You will know what I mean as we move on......

In 6.c we defined maxint() outside of the main() function, so it was global to every function!!!

But here we have maxint() local to only main() function by calling it within it.

int main()
{
	...code....
	MAX(maxint, int);

	...code....
}


Here, as we know MAX(maxint, int); inside the main() is replaced by its definition

int maxint(int x, int y)
{
	return x>y?x:y;
}

Now, this definition is local only to the main() function and thus no outside function can call it....if they do want to call it then then also will have
to call MAX(maxint, int); within them!!!

But display() doesnot call MAX(maxint, int); so an error as "undefined reference to maxint" appears when compiling the program.

But if display() had called MAX(maxint, int); then would not be any errors and the program would execute successfully!!!!
